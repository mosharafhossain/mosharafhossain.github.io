I am a doctoral candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at University of North Texas, advised by Prof. Eduardo Blanco. I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from Tennessee Tech and Bachelorâ€™s Degree from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. My research interests lie in natural language processing and artificial intelligence, particularly understanding and inference with negation, generation of affirmative interpretation of negation, and analysis of negation in machine translation and in multilingual scenarios.
