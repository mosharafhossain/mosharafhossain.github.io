# About Me
<p align="justify">
I am a doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering Department</a> at University of North Texas, advised by Professor <a href="http://www.cse.unt.edu/~blanco/">Eduardo Blanco</a>. My research interests include natural language processing and artificial intelligence, specifically understanding and inferring the semantics of negation, generation of affirmative interpretation for negation, and analyzing negation in machine translation and multilingual situations.

I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.tntech.edu/">Tennessee Tech</a> and Bachelorâ€™s Degree from <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</a>.
