# About Me
<p align="justify">
I am a doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering Department</a> at University of North Texas, advised by Professor <a href="http://www.cse.unt.edu/~blanco/">Eduardo Blanco</a>. My research focuses on natural language understanding, multilinguality, factuality, information extraction, and commonsense reasoning. In particular, I study how to comprehend and reason with several linguistic phenomena such as negation in monolingual and multilingual settings.  
</p>

<p align="justify">
I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.tntech.edu/">Tennessee Tech</a> and Bachelorâ€™s Degree from <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</a>.
