# About Me
<p align="justify">
I am a doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering Department</a> at University of North Texas, advised by Professor <a href="http://www.cse.unt.edu/~blanco/">Eduardo Blanco</a>. The main focus of my research relates to natural language understanding, information extraction, natural language generation, common sense reasoning, and sentential semantics. In particular, I study how to comprehend and reason with several linguistic phenomena such as negation, both in monolingual and multilingual contexts.  
</p>

<p align="justify">
I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.tntech.edu/">Tennessee Tech</a>, and my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</a>.
